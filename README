Apache::AxKit::Provider::File::Formatter version 0.01
=====================================================

This is an AxKit Provider that may be used to apply any module that
conforms with the Formatter API to a file. At the time of this
writing, there are two modules in the C<Formatter::> namespace, one
for formatting the L<Text::Textile> syntax, and one to add minimal
HTML markup to a preformatted plain text.

The Formatter API is a very simple API, designed to do simple
conversion between different syntaxes. It is mostly used to make HTML
from some simple text-based syntax, but it can be used to convert
anything.

This Provider will let you use any syntax that there is a Formatter
module for with minimum effort.


INSTALLATION

To install this module use the CPAN or CPANPLUS tools, or type the
following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This module only depends on AxKit, but you would need to have at least
one of the modules in the Formatter:: namespace to use this Provider
meaningfully. At the time of this writing, only two exist:
Formatter::HTML::Textile and Formatter::HTML::Preformatted.
